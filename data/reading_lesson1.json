    "Mr. Chancellor, Ladies and Gentlemen, when I was approached by the Vice-Chancellor with a request to deliver the Convocation Address, I made it clear to him that there were so many calls on me that I could not possibly prepare a formal Convocation Address on an academic level with regard to the great subjects with which a University deals, such as arts, history, philosophy, science, law and so on.",
    "I did, however, promise to say a few words to the students on this occasion, and it is in fulfilment of that promise that I will address you now.",
    "First of all, let me thank the Vice-Chancellor for the flattering terms in which he referred to me.",
    "Mr. Vice-Chancellor, whatever I am, and whatever I have been able to do, I have done it merely as a measure of duty which is incumbent upon every Mussalman to serve his people honestly and selflessly.",
    "In addressing you I am not here speaking to you as Head of the State, but as a friend, and as one who has always held you in affection.",
    "Many of you have today got your diplomas and degrees, and I congratulate you.",
    "Just as you have won the laurels in your University and qualified yourselves, so I wish you all success in the wider and larger world that you will enter."
